# ObjectPlacementRL

ObjectReplacementRL is a reinforcement learning (RL) model designed to assist robotic arms, particularly Panda robotic arms, in determining the optimal replacement strategy for objects to bring them into accessible regions. The model takes into account the distance and radius of the object as input and outputs the recommended action for replacement.
